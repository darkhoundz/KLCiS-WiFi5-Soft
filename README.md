# KLCiS Voucher System e-payment support for JONAS WiFi5 1ST MULTI WIRELESS WIFI VENDO MACHINE (CENTRALIZED VENDO)

[WiFi5-Soft](https://wifi5-soft.com/) is celebrated as one of the most popular WiFi vending software for 2023. Its popularity is widely recognized within WiFi Hotspot/PisoWiFi Facebook Groups. It has successfully attracted a large number of clients who have migrated from older systems due to its resolution of RANDOM MAC problems, a common issue faced by most vending software. The software has garnered support from various YouTube vloggers, including Karl Andrew C. Comboy.

With the integration of the KLCiS Voucher System, WiFi5-Soft-operated machines will now have the capability to accept e-payments, including Gcash, PayMaya, GrabPay, and ShopeePay. Voucher codes will be automatically generated following a successful payment, accompanied by an SMS notification.
